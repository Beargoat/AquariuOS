🜁 AquariuOS
A New Operating System for Shared Reality

Welcome to AquariuOS — an open-source infrastructure project for building non-extractive, coherence-aligned digital systems that preserve dignity, truth, and inner life.

This is not an app. This is not a product. This is a blueprint for a new civic architecture in the digital age. We are not building another platform; we are building the circulatory system for truth.

🚀 Status: Alpha V1 Released
Alpha V1 was officially released on February 4, 2026.

Current Version
Alpha V1.01 (February 7, 2026)
Major updates based on community feedback from r/AI_Governance, governance researchers, and AI reviewers.

What's New in V1.01:

Foundational Axiom: "Accountability must be survivable" - constitutional core principle
Data Portability Protocol: Exit costs addressed, history migrations enabled
Architectural Floor: Unalienable rights hardcoded against democratic tyranny
Adult Ceremony Extension: Lifelong growth pathway, not just childhood
Temporal Weight Decay: Old errors lose weight as behavior improves

See CHANGELOG.md for complete details.

Previous Versions:
Alpha V1.0 (Feb 4, 2026)


Current focus: Transitioning from design specs to functional protocol testing.

🎯 Next Objective: Minimal Proof-of-Concept (PoC)
Our primary goal between now and June 2026 is to move beyond theory and into lived application.

Focus: Conflict resolution using structured, coherence-aligned frameworks.

Target: Onboarding 30-50 active users for a closed pilot.

Purpose: To stress-test fundamental assumptions regarding distributed accountability and frame-locking before wider scaling.

🌐 Core Components
🧭 1. SharedReality

Digital spaces that enforce frame-locking and context integrity. It prevents gaslighting and weaponized ambiguity by ensuring that "factually accurate but contextually misleading" information is identifiable.

🌐 2. RealityNet

A time-aware substrate that tracks trajectories, not just totals. It allows growth to be architecturally visible, ensuring that mistakes do not define identity forever.

✨ 3. SacredPath / WisdomPath

Inner systems for calibration and self-repair. This allows users to anchor their own coherence through private reflection before engaging with the wider network.

🧠 4. Signal Integrity Protocols (with ERRA)

A full circulatory protocol for detecting and resolving misalignment without resorting to judgment. Co-developed with u/MisterSirEsq, creator of the ERRA framework.

🔒 The Covenant (What We Do Not Do)
We do not adjudicate truth or centralize control.

We do not assign permanent reputation scores or gamify human connection.

We do not remember as punishment; accountability must be survivable.

We do not force resolution; clarified disagreement is a valid end state.

📅 Roadmap
✅ January 2026: Tome & Signal Integrity Protocols v1 complete.

✅ February 4, 2026: Alpha V1 "Minimum Viable Transmission" released.

🔜 June 2026: Launch of the Conflict Resolution PoC (30-50 users).

🔜 June 8, 2026: Tome v1.0 Public Upload.

🤝 Credits & Collaboration
Created by: Efren Gerard (EG) Inspired by: Martin Luther King Jr., The U.S. Constitution, and Systems Theory. Signal Integrity Protocols: Co-developed with u/MisterSirEsq.

🪞 Final Thought
This is not a startup. This is a mirror. If it's real, it doesn't need permission to exist—it just needs you to keep building it.
