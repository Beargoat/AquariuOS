# 🜁 AquariuOS  
**A New Operating System for Shared Reality**

Welcome to **AquariuOS** — an open-source infrastructure project for building **non-extractive, coherence-aligned digital systems** that preserve dignity, truth, and inner life.

This is not an app.  
This is not a product.  
This is **a blueprint for a new civic architecture** in the digital age.

We are not building another platform.  
We are building **the circulatory system for truth.**

## 🚧 Current Status: Pre-Alpha | Design Phase

This repository is currently a staging ground for:
- Visual architecture diagrams
- Formal specs of key protocols
- User flows + interaction concepts
- Collaborator onboarding
- Signal Integrity Protocols implementation (Coherence Marker)

**Target release milestone:**  
📅 February 4, 2026 — *"Minimum Viable Transmission"*  
📅 June 8, 2026 — *"Tome v1.0 Upload"*

## 🌐 Core Components

### 🧭 1. SharedReality
Digital spaces that enforce **frame-locking**, **context integrity**, and **cross-frame accountability**. Prevents gaslighting, weaponized ambiguity, and context collapse.

### 🌐 2. RealityNet
A time-aware, provenance-rich substrate that remembers structure without turning memory into punishment. Enables epistemic accounting at scale without creating surveillance or social scores.

### ✨ 3. SacredPath / WisdomPath
Inner systems for **calibration, self-repair, and growth**. Helps users use the tools on themselves first—restoring their own coherence before projecting outward.

### 🧠 4. Signal Integrity Protocols (with ERRA)
A full circulatory protocol for detecting, preserving, resolving, and learning from misalignment—without resorting to judgment or suppression.  
Co-developed with [u/MisterSirEsq](https://www.reddit.com/user/MisterSirEsq), creator of the **ERRA** framework (Existential Real Resonance Alignment).

## 🧪 What You Can Do Here

* **Explore the Architecture**
   Start with `/docs/tome-condensed.md` *(coming Feb 4)*

* **Fork the Protocols**
   Design your own Coherence Marker extensions

* **Visualize the System**
   Submit a new diagram that helps people *see* it in one glance

* **Add a Use Case**
   How would this system solve a real-world problem you've faced?

* **Build a Prototype**
   Frontend, backend, middleware — it’s all open

## 🔒 What AquariuOS Does *Not* Do

* It does **not** adjudicate truth.
* It does **not** assign permanent reputation scores.
* It does **not** centralize trust in institutions or gatekeepers.
* It does **not** remember as punishment.
* It does **not** force resolution or consensus.

## 🕊️ Why This Exists

> Because current systems fragment us faster than we can repair.
> Because social platforms collapse context, distort memory, and incentivize outrage.
> Because humans have a **Coherence Sense**—and it’s being suppressed by extractive tech.

AquariuOS is a sanctuary for **structural sanity**.
Not just personal, but societal.

We are building the epistemic infrastructure for a **post-fragmentation world**.

NOTE: The name 'AquariuOS' is a placeholder. What matters is not the label but the covenant, the documented restraints that prevent this system from becoming what it exists to resist. If we must rename to preserve the covenant, we will. If someone else claims the name but abandons the covenant, they own the word but not the integrity. Verify implementations by checking the Credibility Ledger, not by trusting the name on the package.

## 🪞 Final Thought

This is not a startup.
This is not a product.
This is **a mirror**.

> "If it's real, it doesn't need the world's permission to exist.
> It just needs you to keep building it."

See you on February 4th.
